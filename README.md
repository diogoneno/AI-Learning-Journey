🚀 AI Engineering Learning Journey

Welcome to my AI Engineering Learning Journey! This repository documents my daily progress as I learn and apply AI engineering concepts, following a structured roadmap.

📅 Learning Plan: Stage 1 (Beginner - 1 Month)

I will dedicate 1 hour per day to learning AI engineering fundamentals and documenting my progress here.

📌 Roadmap Overview

✅ Week 1: APIs & Prompt Engineering

Learn OpenAI & HuggingFace APIs

Work with JSON & REST API calls

Experiment with prompt engineering

Build a simple AI-powered chatbot

Deploy a chatbot UI using Gradio/Streamlit

✅ Week 2: Open Source LLMs & Chains of Operations

Explore HuggingFace transformers & LangChain

Run open-source LLMs locally

Manage context and chaining in AI workflows

Automate operations and deploy basic AI apps

✅ Week 3: AI Application Development

Work with text, image & audio generation

Implement RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)

Learn vector databases (Pinecone, Chroma)

Build basic AI agents

✅ Week 4: Deployment & Practical Applications

Learn about AI deployment

Optimize API calls and performance

Debug AI models and handle security risks

Capstone project: Build & deploy a full AI-powered app

📝 Daily Progress Log

Each day, I will commit my learning progress and projects. Below is a log of my daily updates:
