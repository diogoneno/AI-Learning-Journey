#AI-Learning-Journey
##Welcome to my AI learning journey repository!
This repository documents my daily progress in learning AI engineering, covering everything from APIs and prompt engineering to open-source LLMs and basic deployments.

##Daily Goals
Today’s Focus (Day 1):

##Learn what Large Language Models (LLMs) are.
Understand how LLM APIs (like OpenAI’s) work.
Set up an API key and make my first API request using Python.
What you’ll find in this repository:

A Python script that demonstrates making a request to OpenAI’s API.
A simple example of interacting with an LLM and returning a response.
Notes and code showcasing each step of my learning process.
What’s Next?
Push daily code updates and examples.
Continue building small, focused projects to apply each day’s concepts.
Gradually create more complex and interactive applications as I learn.
Feel free to explore, learn from, and follow along as I document my AI-learning adventure!
